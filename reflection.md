I consulted a friend who had taken CSC 120 last semester, and I attended office hours on Tuesday night 7-9. My initial impressions of Java is it's somewhat similar to Python with just a couple extra steps. It seems overall programming in general uses the same simple concepts like conditions, loops, and functions/methods. Java just seems to be more stricter with its syntax, like how I have to always declare variable types. What worked really well was writing my sudo code down on paper first, translating it to python, and then translating to Java. Watching the Java syntax video for class helped a lot when it came to adjusting to Java, as well as using the official Java documentation website linked on moodle. I found that collaboration and TA hours really helped.
